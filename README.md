- 👋 Hi, we are a team of researchers led by **Dr. Saiprasad (Sai) Ravishankar** in the Department of Computational Mathematics, Science and Engineering at **Michigan State University**.
- 🌱 We work on problems in **computational imaging, image reconstruction, machine learning, signal processing, and optimization**.
- 👀 SLIM focuses particularly on **smart imaging systems** with the development of models and **machine learning methods & theory**, forming a bedrock of some of the group’s efforts.
